# TransferLearning

In this project, we delve into the realm of image classification using state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning. Leveraging the power of transfer learning and incorporating self-attention mechanisms, our objective is to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately distinguishing among 64 distinct classes of images. we buit a CNN model with accuracy 80% . faced GPU challenges to develop model !
